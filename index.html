<h3>1-  What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
<p>
    The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, <br>
     but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration causes a ReferenceError. <br>
      The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.
</p>
<pre>
    
function something() {
    console.log(counter1); // undefined
    console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
    var counter1 = 1;
    let counter2 = 2;
  }
  
</pre>

<h3>2-  What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h3>
<p>
    The for-in loop is a special type of a loop that iterates over the properties of an object, or the elements of an array.
    
</p>
<pre>
    for(variable in object) {
        // Code to be executed
    }
    
</pre>

<h3>3-  Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h3>
<p>
    Local Scope :- variables declared inside a function is inside the local scope. They can only be accessed from within that function, <br>
     that means they can't be accessed from outside code.
</p>
<pre>
    var a=4;
function add()
{
var  q=4;
console.log(a+b);


}
greet()

 console.log(a+q); //error
 //q will be not accesible as it was defined inside the function

</pre>
<p>
    Block scope :- is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with var do not have block scope. <br>
    Block scope tells us that any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.
    
</p>
<pre>
    {
        let abcd = 45;
      }
       console.log(abcd); //reference error as it was defined inside the block
      
</pre>
<p>
    Functional Scope :- variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and <br>
     in the function scope local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function
</p>
<pre>
    function foo(){
        var fruit ='apple';
        console.log('inside function: ',fruit);
    }
    
    foo();                    //inside function: apple
    console.log(fruit);       //error: fruit is not defined 
</pre>
<p>
    scope chain :- JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables.
</p>
<pre>
    var x=24;
function OuterFunction()
{
var s=224;

var innerfunction=function innerfunction()
{

console.log(s);

}
var innerfunction2=function innerfunction2()
{


console.log(x);

}
innerfunction();
innerfunction2();


}
OuterFunction();

</pre>

<h3>4-  What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h3>
<p>
    undefined:-  In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value
</p>
<pre>
    let a;
console.log(a) //Undefined

var testVar; alert(testVar); //shows undefined

 alert(typeof testVar); //shows undefined

</pre>
<p>
    null:- is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:
</p>
<pre>
    var testVar = null; alert(testVar); //shows null

 alert(typeof testVar); //shows object

</pre>

<h3>5- what is Symbol?</h3>
<p>symbol is used to give an unique value which is immutable(which cannt  be changed )</p>
<pre>
    const val1=Symbol("bittu")
const val2=Symbol("bittu")
console.log(val1===val2)
</pre>
<p>
    though the values and data type are same we will get an output of false because foe each and every symbol unique value is genereated 
</p>
<p>because everytime its creating unique symbol</p>

<h3>6-  Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h3>
<p>
    Map is used to retur a new Array <br>
map is used to iterrate through each and every element in an array

</p>
<pre>
    var numbers= [1,2,3,4,5];
    var doubled  = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
    doubled; // [2,4,6,8,10]
</pre>
<p>Filter:Which is used to filter the items in an array</p>
<pre>
    var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
          var greaterThan2 = numbers.filter(n => n > 2);
          greaterThan2; // [3,4,5]  
</pre>

<h3>7-  Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h3>
<p>
    pass by value means that we pass the actual value of the variable into the function. <br>
pass by reference means that instead of passing the value of the variable,we pass the address of variable(location) to the function.
</p>
<pre>
    var a=2;
    var b=a;
    console.log(a);//2
    console.log(b);//2
    a=4;
    console.log(a);//4
    console.log(b);//2
</pre>

<h3>8-  Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code.</h3>
<p>self invoking functions are kind of an anonymous function which gets invoked automatically after its declaration.we dont have to manually invoke it.</p>
<pre>
    (function(){
        let x="hello there!";
        console.log(x);
    })();
</pre>
